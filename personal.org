*** Purpose
Today (7/22) Abby is thinking that she'd like these videos to be designed for classis teams/committees charged with coming up for advice on proposed amendments. I had been thinking that the purpose was to help especially elders and ministers who may attend General Synod to understand our polity better so they can function more effectively and with less frustration.

These purposes are complementary.

** perfectionism
Type 1 is called the Perfectionist. I do have an inclination toward perfectionism, but it is not the same as the 1's perfectionism. It is almost always directed at me, but incompletely so. And it is hardly ever directed at others. Moreover, it is shame driven, arising out of my feelings of failure, inadequacy, envy, and self-loathing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Stanley Bing on what the crapflood of incoming data is doing to your boss's state of mind.

    "BING: Well, what that does is that feeds control freaks with a constant, steady stream of stuff that needs to be controlled. That's what's making people more crazy. And what happens is that everybody goes crazy in a different way. In other words, some people get extremely morose. Other people get very paranoid. You know, it's really like a graded scale of pathology. But it all comes from the same root source, which is, you know, basically personalities under too much duress."

I think one of the emerging leadership skills of the next five years will be learning how to do brilliant filtering -- either programatically or by delegating information-sorting to others. To ultimately become someone whose system accounts for incoming data in smart ways and who never has to make excuses about too much stuff.

Yeah, I know smart execs have delegated for centuries. But I can envision a world where sweating over your beepy electronic device starts looking about as "executive" and "pro-active" as sucking on a crack pipe in the break room.

*** Mac Plus
**** Modem
     The direct cabling method is causing this project to get
     stuck. Time to try a different approach. And it seems that what
     could work is just use the modem to correct to an ftp site, say,
     isp-direct.
**** PROBLEM
     Okay, this is not working.

     Basilisk II (contrary to its own documentation) appears not to do
     Mac+ emulation. Besides, it's seriously out of date/unmaintained.

     So now I'm thinking that perhaps this isn't worth it.

     Sure, it would be fun to play Space Station Pheta again.

     Sure, it would be nice to be able to run my own old Mac version of
     MS-Word to make sure my old files are converted. Once.

     Is any of this really worth the trouble?

     Probably not.

     I still think I want to do some file transfers. But at this stage,
     probably the only thing worth transferring is the system beep with
     Bethany's voice. And I don't know how to do that.

*** Part number for coax reducer
    UG-176/u

*** Settings for PSK-31
I was overdriving the ALC, quite badly. Finally figured out what
should have been obvious: the "Master" volume controls audio input to
the rig. If that's at 100%, of course it will be way too much.

The ideal thing would be to have my mic gain about where I have it for
SSB. So, I adjusted the trimmer pot in the interface. That had only a
little effect. So then I cranked way back the master volume. That did
the trick.

The current setting for the master volume is 23. The mic gain on the
radio is just shy of 1:00.

I must remember to look at the ALC every time in one of these digital
modes. It appears to be sensitive to frequency and power output.

*** Compiling gMFSK

The Debian package does not come with hamlib support compiled in. I
got the source and did it myself. This was the configure command:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
--enable-hamlib

I had to install the following packages:

libgnome-dev
libgnomeui-dev
fftw-dev
hamlib-dev
orbit2
liborbit2-dev

*** IRLP Nodes

W1AQ  - 4907
N5IUF - 4150

*** Hamlib control
in root:
rpc.rigd --set-conf="rts_state=OFF,timeout=1000"\
 -m 113 -r /dev/ttyS0 -s 4800 -p /dev/ttyS0 --ptt-type=RTS

in user app: RPC rig or model 1901 with localhost
or: rigctl -m 1901 -r localhost

*** Settings for Soundmodem

This has been tricky, and I still don't have it working 100%.

At any rate, soundmodem settings are:

- io mode is soundcard
- audio driver is /dev/dsp
- channel 0 mode is afsk, using /dev/soundmodem0

The mixer channel used in Line-in, and make sure that capture is set
to on for that channel (have to use gnome-volume-control or aumix)

I've turned up the "Capture" channel on the gkrellm volume monitor,
too.

The levels have to be just so. Very tricky.

Even with all this, however, it doesn't decode packets 100%. It seems
like it stalls out after a while, or never works.

Easy to have the rig volume too low?

   - short of that, I want to feel on top of my work
   - this has negatively impacted my love for playing music
 - I want to start the next chapter of my working years
   - Why do I feel that GR is much more likely than NBTS?
 - I want to figure out how to handle my communication problems with Tammi
** Living my ministry well

   - trying to limit the time I spend on minor administrative stuff
** Living my days off well
   - exercise
   - prayer
   - thinking
   - not-thinking!
   - not feeling like I have to accomplish something

   - move

** Self-care stuff
*** what feeds me, nourishes me?
    - music (listening and practicing)
    - scholarship
    - looking ahead
    - good conversations
    - good theological dicussion
    - teaching
*** what depletes me?
    - conflict
    - the feeling that this church is going nowhere
    - meetings that drag on
    - loneliness

*** things to discuss with Bonnie M.
    Trust, love. I don't trust most people. Some of that is a lack of
    trust in their competence; some is that I don't trust their
    motives, or their commitment. I know that this in part goes back to
    my relationship/experience with my dad. I also feel that I don't
    entirely (or fully enough) love my parishioners. Both of these
    things limits my commitment and my effectiveness.
*** Coaching Sessions
**** [2012-10-15 Mon]

***** early stuff
      What are my markers?

      Keep in mind the feedback people are giving me about how they see me as a teacher

      gel

***** Hang onto the theo comm stuff!

***** Look for conversation partners about vocation (academic/executive)

***** Look for opportunities that satisfy my appetite for those things for which I'm wanting right now

**** [2012-10-26 Fri]
    - what is most important to me?
    - what gives me pleasure? what fills or depletes me?
      - it's not that I don't ever have to do the depleting things, but
	that I should make sure I have the filling/fulfilling in my
	life when I've been engaged in the depleting
    - if I take something on, I should let something go
    - I'm a bit of a snob (in a good way!)
    - I don't do surface, but I crave depth, and am impatient with
      those (many) who don't or can't likewise crave and do depth
    - if I wasn't a pastor, what would I do?
