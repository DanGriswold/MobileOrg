*** notes: worship that's joyful, energetic, & real
    - how? possible?
    - worship planning feels so constrained
    - I don't allow time for creativity
    - I feel blocked from being creative
    - congregational inertia
    - Does worship here usually feel how it felt to me when I sat in the back of the sanctuary on 4/23?
      - stiff
      - rote
      - flat
    - must have a liturgist workshop
      - and people must attend
      - Catherine, especially
      - focus on knowing your pieces well enough to look up
    - Is there a way for me to connect better with the back of the sanctuary?

    - worship planning feels so constrained
    - I don't allow time for creativity
    - I feel blocked from being creative
    - congregational inertia
    - Does worship here usually feel how it felt to me when I sat in the back of the sanctuary on 4/23?

     - Would be easier to incorporate processional cross

*** Problem: Sunday school feels stuck
    - low attendance
    - congregational inertia
    - my own frustrations
    - Bob seems to be increasingly unhelpful in the class
    - no ideas about what topics to take on next
    - Many seem not truly comfortable with me as a teacher
      - that probably says more about them than me
      - they see me as pastor, not as teacher
      - but the understanding of pastor seems a bit shallow
      - they just want me to show my love by listening, not by teaching/guiding/discipling
      - it's not everybody, of course
      - and some have a learning style that requires them to talk in order to complete the learning
      - the difficulty is that some (Jean) want to talk too much
      - how best to have SS more interactive?
*** Desired Characteristics
    - a return to larger class size
    - healthy involvement of Jean, w/ her no longer trying to have last word
    - topics of interest to me and to the attendees (reflected in attendance)
    - more actual presentation/teaching
    - less opportunity for others to share ignorance or chase rabbits
    - topics that are both theologically and emotionally deep
    - topics that are both theologically interesting and broadly attractive
*** Possible Topics
    - ecclesiology
    - science and faith
    - theology of creativity
    - theology of friendship
    - why be ecumenical

***** Prayer of Confession
 #+BEGIN_VERSE
God of grace, we grieve that the church,
which shares one Spirit, one faith, one hope, and one calling,
has become a broken communion in a broken world.
The one body spans all time, place, race, and language,
but in our fear we have fled from and fought one another,
and in our pride we have mistaken our part for the whole.
Yet we marvel that you gather the pieces to do your work,
that you bless us with joy, with growth, and with signs of unity.
Forgive our sins and help us to commit ourselves
to seeking and showing the unity of the body of Christ.
In his name, Amen.
—based on Our World Belongs to God, Art. 43
 #+END_VERSE
***** Profession of Our Church's Faith
#+BEGIN_VERSE
What do you believe concerning “the holy catholic church”?
I believe that the Son of God
through his Spirit and Word,
out of the entire human race,
from the beginning of the world to its end,
gathers, protects, and preserves for himself
a community chosen for eternal life
and united in true faith.
And of this community I am and always will be
a living member.
—Heidelberg Catechism, Q&A 54

** Important questions
   - What is most important to me?
   - What fills me or depletes me?
   - When I take something on, what will I let go?
   - If I was no longer a pastor, what would I do?

** Affirmations and Intentions
   - make space & schedule time for what matters
   - schedule time for thinking, reading, and pondering, away from the office
   - schedule visits
   - cut myself some slack; be kind to myself
   - my emotions are not final
   - I want to read more poetry
   - I like languages; should I try to read German again? Or learn Russian?
   - what are my spiritual gifts?

** Strengths & Weaknesses
   I find that ministry calls on me, and gives me many opportunities, to build on my strengths and find corrections for my weaknesses.
** Vision doc
   I am frustrated and discouraged. Why did I even bother? I can't get enough people in this congregation to support this, really support it. I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to be doing with it anymore.
** Pastoral Rhythm
What is the weekly rhythm of great pastors? (I'm thinking of Harrell, Zahnd, Ayers, Jongerius, Edwards-Chase, and Norden.) Not that I have to have the same rhythm, but I might be able to learn from them.  
** What I need
   - is both solitude and interaction, sound and silence
** Communion
I found Hunsinger's book so stimulating.

What can, or should, be added to the communion prayer in order to introduce the notion of sacrifice along the lines Hunsinger lays out?

There's something true, even in my Reformed context, about the priestly role and identity of the minister. I also think about the episcopal role and identity that I am given and inhabit, sometimes (appreciatively) called "the Bishop" by Dave Ryder.

What do I make of, how do I understand, the tension between my theological preferences for frequent communion, even the need for it my soul feels for it, and how difficult its performance is as a practical matter?

Some of this difficulty is also about how long things take in worship. If there were no announcements, children's message, and anthem, then there would be plenty of time for communion.
** I feel better when I ...
   - exercise
   - pray
   - don't drink too much
   - can talk to a friend
   - get good sleep
   - play my viola
** René Girard
   Scot Sherman gave a talk about him; I'd like to read something by him

*** initial reflections
 1. I desire, or require, more conversation with members
    - pastoral conversation
      - a listening and responding orientation
      - out and about
      - coffee shops, cafes, bars
      - homes
    - theological conversation
      - a speaking and leading orientation
      - pubs and coffeehouses
      - like my Plano breakfast group
      - teaching, encouraging, discipling
      - see this in a discipling context
      - ask Jill > it?
      - small group & individual interaction
    - at TRC, can pastoral conversation lead to theological conversation?
      - I know the reverse can happen
	- which may be the best or even only way
      - not sure this is the right question
      - once the conversation gets pastoral, can one go back to a theological conversation?
      - maybe it's much more dynamic
      - yet some TRC people don't have any interest in theological conversation
	- lack of capacity or comfort
	- but they aren't really wanting pastoral conversation either,
	  - they just want a sounding board
      - is it okay to say that this simply isn't for them?
    - this requires correspondence and scheduling
      - that's something I resist, and I don't know why
 2. Who might be interested
    - The kinds of people:
      - intellectually curious and thoughtful
      - spiritually growing
      - available
    - Particular people:
      - Ben Cooper
      - Cole Palen
      - Pati
      - Steve Letter
      - Don Wolf
      - YiFen
      - Alexis
      - Alex Perec
 3. Format possibilities
    - discussion of readings
    - topic oriented
    - question driven
 4. Is there any point in starting this if I might be leaving?
    - however
      - it might be a good example to them
      - they might continue without me

*** reflections after the July elders' meeting
    - some /will/ respond well to expectations and required work
    - What I am wanting and what YiFen seems to have in mind differ
    - Things that interest me
      - subjects / topics

	- spiritual disciplines
