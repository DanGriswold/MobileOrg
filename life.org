* Things I want to do this year

** Contact
** Experiences
   - Go to CO again
   - RPO concert w Tammi

** Reading
   - Read 12 books
   - Keep up with Strings mag and the Sunday D&C

** Writing

* What do I want to do or accomplish
  Yes, this is quite similar to the previous. I think it's at both a higher and lower level. (Not sure that makes sense)

 - Get lighter and stronger

 - Learn something from the Bach Partitas & Sonatas well enough to perform

 - Read books (not just blogs)

 - Make great progress on my own book

 - Be a great president for PSO

I'm talking about habits. I need to develop stronger habits

 - exercising

 - practicing

 - reading

 - writing

 - attending to PSO stuff (on my terms, in my time)

How do I develop those habits? It's hard, when I already feel like I have no time available and I feel exhausted
